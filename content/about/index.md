Hi, I'm **marsevilspirit**.

I am a software engineer originally from Northeast China, currently pursuing a degree in IoT Engineering at Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications. My primary languages are **Go, C/C++, and Rust**, and I deeply enjoy the process of diving closer to the bare metal.

For me, **Neovim** is more than just an editor; it is a prerequisite for my enjoyment of programming. I am obsessed with the freedom of having total control within the terminal. The sensation of a direct connection between my fingertips and logic is the true source of my passion for coding.

In terms of coding philosophy, I am a **minimalist**. I despise over-encapsulation and unnecessary complexity, always striving for code that is elegant and intuitive.

**My Journey**
- **2025 Google Summer of Code (GSoC):** I spent a fulfilling summer with the **Apache Dubbo** community. It was a journey that not only sharpened my technical skills but also allowed me to experience the charm of collaboration in the open-source world.
- **OceanBase Internship:** I am currently navigating the deep waters of distributed databases. From the Raft protocol and storage engines to distributed transactions—within this massive system, I am voraciously absorbing everything related to "Consistency" and "High Availability."

This is my **digital autobiography**. I use it to document my technical pitfalls and growth, and to combat the solitude often found in technical exploration. I hope the words written here serve as another medium for me to connect with the world.
