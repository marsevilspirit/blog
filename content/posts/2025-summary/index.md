Looking back at December 17th, 2025 was a year of "new beginnings" and "tough choices" for me.

The story began with a trip to Japan at the start of the year. Turning 20 and traveling to Japan was truly meaningful—a way to tie up the loose ends of my past.

At that time, I was actively involved in the dubbo-go community, full of curiosity about the open source world.

In the first half of the year, I dedicated all my energy to GSoC. The successful completion of my project on September 10th was not just a victory in code, but also accumulated invaluable open source experience for my future technical path.

In October, I faced the first major crossroads of my career. With offers from OceanBase and ByteDance's Database team in hand, I went through a long and careful deliberation. Ultimately, my desire to explore distributed systems led me to make a decision—joining OceanBase.

For this passion, I traveled alone to Beijing, starting my journey as a "Beipiao" (Beijing migrant worker) and technical deep-diving journey as a kernel development intern.
