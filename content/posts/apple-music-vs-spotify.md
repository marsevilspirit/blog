title = 'Apple Music VS Spotify'

+++

I have been using Apple Music for two years, and it has always satisfied me. It is a perfect app, and no other music player can reach the high quality of sound that Apple Music has. Apple Music has given me so many memories and wonderful experiences and has accompanied me through countless difficulties and challenges.

Recently, while reading the weekly report on [nvim plugins](https://dotfyle.com/this-week-in-neovim/77), I noticed a [plugin](https://dotfyle.com/this-week-in-neovim/77#user-content-antonvanasschemusic-controlsnvim) called [music-controls.nvim](https://github.com/AntonVanAssche/music-controls.nvim). I was immediately attracted by its features. You can use nvim commands to control the music player, which is a very innovative idea. It means that nvim is not just a tool for writing code; I really like that feeling. Unfortunately, this plugin does not support Apple Music and mainly supports Spotify.

I had never used Spotify before, but I knew it was very popular, so I thought I would give it a try. Before trying it out, I Googled it, and many people said that the interface is messy, and the free version is not very good; so I was mentally prepared for that. I thought there would be some VIP limitations and different tiers. However, when I tried it, it was completely different from what I expected. The interface is very clean, and the experience is smooth. There were no songs that needed a VIP account. I thought it would be like QQ Music or NetEase Cloud Music in China, but Spotify was just perfect. Those foreigners probably haven’t experienced the premium versions in China, like Diamond VIP or Gold VIP... otherwise, they would be shocked! Compared to those services, Spotify is like the sky above and those others below.

I find both Apple Music and Spotify to be excellent, but I would still choose Apple Music in the end because I am a big Apple fan. Apple Music has truly been with me for a very long time. I’m a traditional person, and that’s why I still use Neovim. However, I will continue to use Spotify as well, because it integrates very well with my Neovim. I can control playback and pause Spotify right inside Neovim, including shuffling and looping songs. Moreover, it makes me realize just how much better it is compared to music players in China.

Actually, Apple Music also has a plugin that integrates with Neovim, but that plugin needs to run AppleScript, which means it can only be used on a Mac. This fact has made me even more determined to buy a MacBook in the future.

Finally, I want to share my favorite singer, [Shion Tsuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shion_Tsuji). I love every single one of her songs, especially the song '[Pose](https://open.spotify.com/track/1Namp0zU6fbrj8hXO0quIA)' from the album '[OH! MY MISTAKES!](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=OH!_MY_MISTAKES!_(Tsuji_Shion_album)&action=edit&redlink=1)' The chorus has three fast, jumping melodies that really catch my attention, and the clear and beautiful singing at the end just stays with me. The piano chords throughout the song really grab my ears. I’m not sure if she is famous, but I know her music has become a very important part of my life.
