On January 7, 2025, I traveled to Japan. I should have documented this experience sooner, but upon my return, I was occupied with preparations for Google Summer of Code (GSoC), leaving me with little time. Fortunately, I was eventually chosen for GSoC, so I have decided to pen a blog post to commemorate this unforgettable journey.

I stayed in Japan for about ten days and saw a lot of new things. It was just like I imagined Japan would be. I visited three cities: Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo. Each city has its own unique features and left a deep impression on me.

On January 7th at noon, I landed at Kansai International Airport in Osaka. Before landing, I looked out the window and was amazed to see that Japan is really an island in the sea. I was born in China, so I had never seen this kind of landscape before. After landing, we took the airport bus to the subway station. On the way, looking at the sea outside the bus reminded me of [EVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion), but in EVA, the sea is red! XD

After that, I took the subway to [Namba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namba). My hotel was nearby, close to many famous places. I quickly spoke a little in English with the hotel’s front desk and couldn’t wait to go out and have fun. Right outside my hotel was [Shinsaibashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsaibashi), so that was my first stop.

Shinsaibashi is really a beautiful place and matches my impression of Osaka's retro style. There were many tourists, almost all of them were foreigners. After that, I ate some food there. It looked very pretty, but it wasn't as delicious as I expected.

Each shop looked very fancy, and what left a deep impression on me was the big crab. That is really huge.

It was evening.  TODO
