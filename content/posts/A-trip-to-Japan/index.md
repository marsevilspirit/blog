On January 7, 2025, I traveled to Japan. I should have documented this experience sooner, but upon my return, I was occupied with preparations for Google Summer of Code (GSoC), leaving me with little time. Fortunately, I was eventually chosen for GSoC, so I have decided to pen a blog post to commemorate this unforgettable journey.

I stayed in Japan for about ten days and saw a lot of new things. I visited three cities: Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo. Each city has its own unique features and left a deep impression on me.

#### January 7

At noon on January 7th, I landed at Osaka Kansai International Airport. Before landing, I looked out the window and was still amazed to see that Japan truly is an island nation surrounded by the sea. After landing, we needed to take an airport bus to the subway station. Looking out at the ocean from the window on the way there reminded me of *Evangelion* ([EVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion)), but in *EVA*, the sea is red.

After that, I took the subway to [Namba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namba). My hotel was nearby, close to many famous places. I quickly spoke a little in English with the hotel’s front desk and couldn’t wait to go out and have fun. Right outside my hotel was [Shinsaibashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsaibashi), so that was my first stop.

Shinsaibashi is really a beautiful place and matches my impression of Osaka's retro style. There were many tourists, almost all of them were Chinese. After that, I ate some food there. It looks very appetizing, but it wasn't as delicious as I expected.

Each shop looked very fancy, and what left a deep impression on me was the big crab. That is really huge.

Because I don’t exercise much, I went back to the hotel to rest for a while. In the evening, I went out for a walk again. [Dotonbori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Dtonbori) is near Shinsaibashi. I went there to walk around, and there were izakayas everywhere.

They looked very tempting, but I had already decided what to eat for dinner, so I resisted the temptation and went back.  Since I was really hungry, I went straight to my destination for the night—[Ichiran Ramen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichiran). I waited in a long line, and when I finally got to eat, it was incredibly tasty! The noodles were chewy, the broth was clear but very rich in flavor, the beef slices melted in my mouth, and the soft-boiled egg was perfect. It was so good that after finishing one bowl, I ordered another one!

After eating and drinking enough, I went back to the hotel to rest and prepare for the trip to Universal Studios the next day.

#### January 8

It was also a perfect day. I woke up around 8:00 and went [Universal Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios_Japan). When I arrived, the doors were already open. Before I even went inside, I heard people screaming from the roller coasters, which was quite shocking.

The first place I visited was the Harry Potter theme park, and it really felt incredibly authentic. Some people were waving their wands, which they had bought from the themed shop, and dramatically reciting spells at specific attractions. I also got to see a magnificent replica of Hogwarts Castle.

Then I visited the much-talked-about [Super Nintendo World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_World). Although I ended up waiting in line for quite a while, it wasn't as fun as I had imagined. That said, the attention to detail in the scenery and set design was truly impressive!

I ate some delicious food at Universal Studios. I ordered the fries and sandwich set at the Jaws-themed restaurant. The slightly salty fries and the delicious, juicy sandwich, paired with an ice-cold coke to cut through the richness—it was standard 'American white person food', but it tasted genuinely good.

The classic British dinner at the Harry Potter restaurant was surprisingly mixed. I really didn't like the mushroom soup and the unseasoned carrots, but the sweet corn, the tender and juicy chicken drumstick, the meat patty covered in delicious sauce, and the moist pie were all quite good.
